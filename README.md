# Data Structure and Algorithms in Java Assignment 1



Assignment Objectives:
Java ADT, Linked Lists, Stacks, Recursion and Big-O efficiency.


Part 1 - (30 marks)
The source file Timing.java (available on blackboard) contains some very mysterious functions namely, mickey(), minnie(), donald(), goofy(), pluto(), gyro() and daffy() and also fact(). Your task is in this first part of your assignment is to develop a driver (name it TestTiming.java) that analyzes the performance of these functions experimentally.
Background - Timing Methods
The snippet below is an example of how to use StopWatch (available on blackboard) to time functions.
  a. For method daffy() develop a new method (called by your driver) to test and time this function testing for values of n from 30 through 44. Plot your results/analysis.
  b. Repeat a) with method donald()
  c. Develop a new method (called by your driver) to test mickey(). To initialize, make an array of size n with randomarr(n). The initialization of the array should not be inside the timing calls. Use values of n of 1000, 2000, 4000 ... through to 8192000. Plot your results/analysis.
  d. Develop a new method (called by your driver) to test minnie(). To initialize, make an array of size n with randomarr(n). The initialization of the array should not be inside the timing calls. Use values of n of 1000, 2000, 4000 ... through 256000. Plot your results/analysis.
  e. Repeat d) with methods goofy(), and pluto().
  f. Develop a new method (called by your driver) to test gyro(). For gyro(), make an array using randomarr(n) and call pluto on it first (pluto should not be included in the timing). Use values of n of 1000, 2000, 4000 … through 256000. Plot your results/analysis.
  g. Develop a new method (called by your driver) to test fact(BigInteger n). For fact(BigInterger n), test values n from 1000 through to 64000, doubling n each time.
  
Example of how you can make a BigInteger:
A BigInteger bign that is not too large can be converted to an int using bign.intValue(). There are operations .add(), .subtract(), .multiply() and .divide(), each with a BigInteger argument utilize if needed.
 For each method, plot the time taken utilizing Microsoft excel for graphing. You should research how to plot data utilizing excel as this is used extensively in industry. Ideallly you will be plotting time take vs n. You should use these values as a basis to deduce your conclusion and estimate the Big-O for the respective function accordingly. Please state your Big-O effriciency conclusion for each method clearly on the graph.
 Note that the timer provided will not be accurrate for very small times (less than a millisecond). If any recorded times of a functions are too small, do not include those times in your graph/report (since thy simply act as noice to your calculations and estimates).
 The time of the StopWatch in seconds can be obtained (as a double) as timer.time();
 For small values of the input size, the times will be noisy and the ratio will not be meaningful, so you may need to ignore the first few timing calculation values, concentrating on the ratio for larger inputs.
 Your deliverables for this first part of the assignment is the excel spreadsheet containing your plotting data with your conclusions/extimates of the Big-O efficiencies for each of the mysterious methods (deduce your conclusions on the excel spreadsheet or a separate word document – be clear and explain your conclusions referring to your calculated data) in addition to your driver (TestTiming.java) that tests and executes the methods in accordance with the instructions provided from questions a) through g).



Part 2 – (30 marks)
Create a file named StringRecursion.java that implements the described methods below. Additionally create a separate driver class (TestRecursion.java) to test the methods described below.
Please note the following restrictions for Part 2:
 Your methods must be recursive.
 No credit/grade will be given for any methods that employ iteration.
 No global variables (variables declared outside of the method) are allowed.
HINT: You may find it helpful to employ substring(), charAt() and length() methods of the java String class as part of your solutions.
  a. public static void printWithSpaces(String str)
This method should use recursion to print the individual characters in the string str separated by spaces.
For example, printWithSpaces(“space”) should prodiced the following output:
The method should not return a value. The method should not do any printing if the empty string (“”) or the value null is passed in the parameter.
  b. public static String weave(String str1, String str2)
This method should use recursion to return the string that is formed by “weaving” togeather the characters in the str1 and str2 to create a single string.
For example:
 weave(“aaaa”, “bbbb”) should return the string “abababab”
 weave(“hello”,”world”) should return the string “hweolrllod”
If one of the strings is longer that the other, its “extra” characters (the ones with no counterparts in the shorter string) should appear immediately after the “woven” characters (if any) in the returned string.
For example:
 weave(“recurse”, ”NOW”) should return the string “rNeOcWurse”.
Once again this method should not do any printing; it should simply return the resulting string. If null is passed in either parameter, the method should throw a “COMP2080AssignmentInputException”.
If the empty string (“”) is passed in for either string, the method should return the other string.
For example:
 weave(“hello”,””) should return “hello”
 weave(“”, “”) should return “”
  c. public static int lastIndexOf(char ch, String str)
This method should use recursion to find and return the index of the last occurrence of the characters ch in the string str, or -1 if ch does not occur in the str.
For example:
 lastIndexOf(‘r’,”recurse”) should return 4
 lastIndexOf(‘p’,”recurse”) should return -1
This method should not do any printing; it should simply return the resulting string. The method should return -1 if the empty string (“”) or the value or null value is passed as the second parameter.


Problem 3 – (40 marks)
A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same forward as it does backward.
For example, the following below are examples of palindromes:
1. “Taco cat” and “don’t nod”
2. “a man, a plan, a canal, Panama”
Please note, when determining if a string is a palindrome, we ignore characters that are not letters and we additionally ignore the case.
For this problem you are to do the following:
a. Write a java program that uses a stack to check for palindromes in each line of a text file. Try your program on the text file provided (palindrones.txt posted on blackboard).
Your program should output the palindromes that it finds in the document (or any document) fed to it.
For example:
HINT / NOTE: You must write your own stack class for this problem (do not use any built-in stack or api). Your must also implement your stack using LinkedLists (not arrays, and not ArrayLists).
